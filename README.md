The name of my project is Car Rental System. It is a web-based application. This project is built using Spring Boot, Angular, and MySQL.
This project features two distinct roles- Admin and User

Admin:- 
1. CRUD Operation of Cars- Admin can create, read, update, and delete the list of cars
2. Advanced Car Search- Both admin and user can search the car
3. Admin can handle the booking requests - Approve or Reject
   
Users:-
1. The user can send a request to book a car for a specific date and time.
2. Users can also check their past booking history.
